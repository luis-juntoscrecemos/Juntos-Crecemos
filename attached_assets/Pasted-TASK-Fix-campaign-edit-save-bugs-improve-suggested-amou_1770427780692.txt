TASK: Fix campaign edit save bugs + improve suggested amounts UX + prevent image loss + add % progress display + add recurring interval editor.

CONTEXT
- We have an admin “Edit campaign” view/card where org admins can update campaign fields (title, goal, image, preset amounts, etc.).
- Preset “Cantidades sugeridas” chips work, but we need UX improvements + persistence fixes.
- Donations are recorded and used to compute progress/analytics.

ISSUES TO FIX (REQUIRED)

1) GOAL INPUT WILL NOT CLEAR / DOES NOT SAVE
Problem:
- In the “Meta/Goal” input, if I try to delete the value (clear the field), the numbers reappear.
- Also, changes to goal are not saving.

Likely cause:
- Controlled input is bound to a numeric state and forced through parseInt on every keystroke, so empty string becomes NaN and the UI resets to the previous value.
- Save handler may not be including `goal_amount` in the update payload, or update is failing silently.

Fix requirements:
- Treat goal input as a string while editing (local state `goalDraft: string`).
- Allow empty string while typing.
- On blur or on Save:
  - Validate: required and > 0 (or decide whether empty is invalid)
  - Convert to integer and persist to DB as `goal_amount`.
- Ensure the update mutation includes `goal_amount` and shows success/error toast.
Acceptance:
- I can clear the field while typing.
- Entering a new goal and clicking Save persists it. Refresh shows the new goal.

2) MOVE “CANTIDADES SUGERIDAS” SECTION UNDER TITLE + IMPROVE CUSTOM AMOUNTS CHIPS
Requirements:
- Move the entire “Cantidades sugeridas” section to immediately below the “Campaign title” field (top of the edit card).
- Custom amounts:
  - When I add a custom amount, it should appear as a green chip like the preset chips.
  - It must be toggleable on/off (selected/unselected) like the presets.
  - It must also keep an “x” remove icon so it can be removed entirely (to avoid overcrowding).
- Data rules:
  - The campaign’s saved `preset_amounts` is the set of “enabled/selected” chips.
  - If a chip is toggled off, it should NOT be included in `preset_amounts` (or store it separately—see below).
Implementation suggestion (choose one):
Option A (Simple):
  - Keep only one list: `preset_amounts` (selected amounts).
  - Custom amount input adds the number directly into `preset_amounts`.
  - Toggling off removes from `preset_amounts` (but chip can still show as “available” only if we keep a second list).
Option B (Better UX):
  - Maintain two lists in UI state:
    - `available_amounts` (all chips shown: presets + custom added)
    - `preset_amounts` (selected/enabled amounts saved to DB)
  - Custom adds to `available_amounts`; toggle controls membership in `preset_amounts`; “x” removes from available (and from preset_amounts if present).
If DB schema doesn’t support `available_amounts`, keep it UI-only and reconstruct from presets + custom list in local state. If you must persist it, add `available_amounts` jsonb.

Acceptance:
- Suggested amounts section appears directly under title.
- Custom added amounts appear as green chips.
- Custom chips can be toggled on/off and can be removed with “x”.
- Public page `/donar/[campaign-slug]` uses the saved selected amounts.

3) CAMPAIGN PICTURE DISAPPEARS AFTER SAVING AMOUNTS (TROUBLESHOOT)
Problem:
- After adding a new amount and saving, the campaign image disappears.

Likely causes:
- Update call overwrites the whole campaign object and sets `image_url` to null/undefined because it wasn’t included in the payload.
- Form state for image_url is not initialized properly, or Save uses a partial object but incorrectly sets missing fields.

Fix requirements:
- Update logic must be PATCH-like:
  - Only update changed fields, OR
  - Always include the existing `image_url` when saving other fields.
- Verify image_url is read from DB and stored in state on load.
- Ensure the image upload/URL field persists and does not get cleared by unrelated saves.
Acceptance:
- Editing/saving amounts does not remove the image.
- Image remains visible after refresh.

4) SHOW CAMPAIGN PROGRESS % ON:
   - Campaign card in the DASHBOARD
   - Donation form page
And keep it correct even if the goal changes.
Requirements:
- Display “{percent}% completado” near the progress bar.
- percent = (amount_raised / goal_amount) * 100
- Clamp to 0–100+ (if over goal, show 100% or show “120%” depending on design; choose one and be consistent).
- amount_raised must be computed from real donations for that campaign (status='succeeded').
- If org admin changes goal_amount, percentage recalculates automatically based on the new goal.
Acceptance:
- After a donation, the % updates.
- After changing goal, the % changes accordingly without breaking.

5) ADD RECURRING DONATION OPTIONS EDITOR IN CAMPAIGN EDIT CARD
Requirements:
- Add a “Donaciones recurrentes” section in the campaign edit card.
- Similar UX to amounts:
  - A set of interval chips/options: weekly, monthly, semiannual, yearly
  - Admin can toggle intervals on/off (enabled intervals).
  - Admin can choose a default interval (must be one of the enabled ones).
- Persist to DB fields (create if missing):
  - allow_recurring (boolean)
  - recurring_intervals (text[] or jsonb array)
  - default_recurring_interval (text)
Validation:
- If allow_recurring = false, intervals/default can be hidden or disabled.
- If allow_recurring = true, at least one interval must be enabled.
Acceptance:
- Admin can add/remove recurring intervals and set default.
- Public donation form reflects enabled intervals if recurring is selected.

DELIVERABLES
- Fix controlled input behavior for goal + persist updates
- Reposition and enhance “Cantidades” section + custom chip behavior
- Fix image persistence bug (PATCH updates / include image_url)
- Add % completed display to progress bars (dashboard + donor page)
- Add recurring intervals editor + persistence
- Add tests/sanity checks to ensure update payloads don’t wipe other fields
