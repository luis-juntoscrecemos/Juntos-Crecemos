TASK: Improve the public donation form UX + add Terms page + add placeholder card fields + ensure submissions count as real donations in the org admin dashboard.

CONTEXT
- Public donation route exists: `/donar/[campaign-slug]`
- We do NOT have a payment processor integrated yet, but we want the UI to look like a real checkout.
- Today, when a donor submits the form, we want the submission to be treated as a real donation for reporting purposes (so it appears in the org admin “Panel” dashboard metrics and recent donations list).

REQUIREMENTS

1) TOTAL SECTION MUST ALWAYS SHOW (sticky at bottom)
- Add a “Resumen / Total” area that is visible at the bottom of the donation form at all times.
- It must show:
  - Donación: {amount}
  - Tarifas de procesamiento: {fee_amount}  (show 0 if donor is not covering fees)
  - Total: {total_amount}
- Behavior:
  - If donor has NOT selected “cover fees”, fee_amount = 0 and total_amount = amount.
  - If donor selects “cover fees”, compute fee_amount and total_amount updates live.
- UI:
  - This should be pinned/sticky at the bottom of the form container (or as a persistent bottom bar on mobile).
  - The total must update immediately when amount changes, preset selection changes, custom amount changes, or cover-fees toggle changes.

2) FIX “TERMS AND CONDITIONS” CHECKBOX ALIGNMENT
- The label text “Acepto Términos y Condiciones” is vertically misaligned with the checkbox (text sits too low).
- Fix the alignment using proper layout (flex + items-start/items-center) so the checkbox and first line of text align correctly.
- Keep spacing consistent with the rest of the form.

3) CREATE A “TERMS AND CONDITIONS” PAGE + LINK IT FROM THE FORM
- Create a public page route: `/terminos` (Spanish)
- Add basic Terms & Conditions content template (can be placeholder but professional and relevant to donations):
  - acceptance of terms
  - donation nature (non-refundable unless stated)
  - data/privacy reference
  - payment processing disclaimer (even if future)
  - contact email placeholder
- On the donation form, in the checkbox label text, make “Términos y Condiciones” a link to `/terminos` (opens in new tab preferred).

4) ADD CREDIT CARD INPUT FIELDS (UI ONLY, NO PROCESSING YET)
- Add a “Pago con tarjeta” section at the bottom of the form (above the submit button OR just before the sticky total; choose best UX).
- Fields required:
  - Name on card
  - Card number
  - Expiration (MM/YY)
  - CVV
- IMPORTANT:
  - These fields are ONLY UI placeholders for now (no payment processing).
  - Do NOT store raw card data in the database.
  - Add client-side validation for formatting only (length/pattern), but do not block submission if we decide to keep it lightweight.
  - Add helper text: “Procesamiento de pagos próximamente” or similar.

Security requirement:
- Ensure the code never sends card fields to the backend and never logs them.

5) SUBMITTING DONATION MUST COUNT AS A REAL DONATION IN THE ORG “PANEL” DASHBOARD
- Right now, after submitting a donation, we want it to appear:
  - In dashboard KPI cards (amount, # donations, etc.)
  - In “Recent donations” list
- Implement by writing a record into the same table the dashboard reads from for donations.
  - If dashboard currently reads from `donations`, then on submit insert into `donations`.
  - Use status = 'succeeded' (or equivalent) so it’s included in metrics.
- Record fields should include at minimum:
  - organization_id
  - campaign_id
  - donor_first_name
  - donor_last_name
  - donor_email
  - donor_note
  - amount
  - cover_fees boolean
  - fee_amount
  - total_amount
  - donation_type (one_time/recurring)
  - recurring_interval if applicable
  - created_at
  - transaction_id (use generated uuid as transaction id if no provider)
- Ensure the donor submission writes organization_id correctly (derived from the campaign’s organization_id).
- After submission:
  - Redirect to a confirmation/receipt page (existing `/donaciones/[id]` summary page if present) OR show success state with the transaction id.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT tie this to any payment provider yet. We’re simulating “paid” donations for now so we can validate the product UX and dashboards.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Total summary is always visible and correct (fee shows 0 when not selected).
- Terms checkbox alignment is visually correct.
- `/terminos` page exists and is linked from the donation form text.
- Card fields appear, validate lightly, and are never sent/stored/logged.
- Submitting the donation creates a donation record that immediately shows up in the org admin dashboard metrics and recent donations list.

DELIVERABLES
- Updated `/donar/[campaign-slug]` donation form UI + sticky total
- New `/terminos` page
- Updated submission flow to create a real donation record used by the dashboard
- Any necessary DB updates/migrations (ONLY if required)
- Ensure no sensitive card data is persisted anywhere
