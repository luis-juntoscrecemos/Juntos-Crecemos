FEATURE: Upgrade “Organization Sign Up” flow to collect and persist organization profile data.

CURRENT STATE
- App uses Supabase Auth email/password for org signup.
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- There is an `organizations` table in Supabase.
- Goal: email belongs to the organization account (not an individual person).

NEW SIGNUP FORM (ORG REGISTER)
Replace the org registration UI to include:
1) Organization Name (required)
2) Organization Website (optional but validate URL format if present)
3) Organization Logo upload (optional at signup; file types png/jpg/webp; max 2MB)
4) Email (required)
5) Password + Confirm Password (required)

DATA MODEL REQUIREMENTS (SUPABASE)
We must store this data in the `organizations` table:
- name (text)
- website (text nullable)
- email (text)  // org email, same as auth email
- logo_url (text nullable) OR logo_path (text nullable)
- slug (text unique) // generated from name
- created_at (timestamp default now())

If columns do not exist yet, provide SQL to add them (no breaking changes).

AUTH + INSERT FLOW (IMPORTANT ORDER)
On submit:
A) Create Supabase auth user with email/password.
B) Immediately create an `organizations` row using the submitted org data.
   - Generate `slug` from org name (lowercase, hyphenated, remove accents, ensure uniqueness with a suffix if needed).
   - Save `email` to the organizations row.
C) If logo was provided:
   - Upload to Supabase Storage bucket named `org-logos` (create bucket if needed).
   - File path convention: `${orgId}/logo.<ext>` (use the newly created org row id).
   - After upload, generate a public URL (or signed URL depending on policy) and update `organizations.logo_url` (or save logo_path).
D) Create/link relationship:
   - If the project uses `organization_users`, insert a row linking the auth user id to the org id with role `admin`.
   - If not used, store `owner_user_id` on organizations (add column if needed) and set it to auth user id.

RLS + STORAGE POLICIES (DO NOT SKIP)
- Ensure RLS allows the newly created authenticated org account to:
  - insert its own org row (during signup)
  - update its org row (for logo_url update)
- Ensure storage policy allows authenticated users to upload to `org-logos` under their org folder.
If policies are missing, output the SQL policies needed.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Use shadcn/ui components.
- Show inline errors (password mismatch, invalid URL, upload too large, etc.)
- Disable submit while processing; show spinner.
- On success redirect to Organization Dashboard and display the org name + logo if available.
- Ensure the login page still works for org accounts.

BRANDING
- Add the Juntos Crecemos logo to the auth pages (Login/Register layouts).
- I will provide the logo asset. Create a clear place for it (e.g., `client/src/assets/juntos-crecemos-logo.svg`) and render it at the top of auth cards.

DELIVERABLES
- List files changed.
- Provide any SQL migrations/policies required (tables + storage).
- Confirm the signup flow writes rows into `organizations` and uploads logos to storage.
