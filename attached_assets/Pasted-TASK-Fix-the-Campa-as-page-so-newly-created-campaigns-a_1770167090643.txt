TASK: Fix the “Campañas” page so newly created campaigns appear immediately, and properly connect campaigns to the authenticated organization via organizations_users + Supabase RLS/auth.

CURRENT SYMPTOM
- Creating a campaign succeeds (no error toast), but the campaign list stays empty.
- This is likely because the campaigns list fetch does not include the Supabase Bearer token and/or the response shape is not handled consistently.

CODE LOCATIONS (IN THIS REPO)
- Campaign page: client/src/pages/Campaigns.tsx
- Global React Query fetcher: client/src/lib/queryClient.ts
- Auth’d API helper (already adds Bearer token): client/src/lib/api.ts (campaignsApi.list/create/update/delete)
- Server routes: server/routes.ts (GET/POST /api/campaigns use authMiddleware and organizationId)
- Org membership: organizations_users table provides org_id for the authenticated auth user

ROOT CAUSE TO FIX
In Campaigns.tsx, useQuery uses only queryKey ['/api/campaigns'] and therefore uses getQueryFn from queryClient.ts, which does fetch() WITHOUT Authorization header. But /api/campaigns requires authMiddleware, so it returns 401 and the UI shows no campaigns.

REQUIRED FIX (choose best approach and implement consistently)
Option A (preferred): Update client/src/lib/queryClient.ts getQueryFn to attach Supabase access token:
- Import getAccessToken from client/src/lib/supabase (same helper used in client/src/lib/api.ts).
- For any request whose URL starts with "/api", add header Authorization: Bearer <token>.
- Keep credentials include if needed, but Bearer token must be present.
- Ensure errors are surfaced (don’t silently swallow 401).

Option B: In client/src/pages/Campaigns.tsx, set queryFn explicitly:
- useQuery({ queryKey: ['/api/campaigns'], queryFn: campaignsApi.list })
- Adjust parsing because campaignsApi.list returns ApiResponse<T> where server wraps { data: ... }.
- Ensure campaigns list becomes an array (not nested objects).

CAMPAIGN FIELDS / FORM ENHANCEMENTS
The “Nueva campaña” dialog currently has: title, slug, description, goal_amount, is_active.
Add:
- suggested_amounts (optional): input as comma-separated numbers, store as array (e.g., [20000,50000,100000])
- currency (default COP) (either a hidden default or dropdown)
Optional (nice-to-have):
- start_date, end_date
- cover_image_url (stub UI if storage not ready)

SUPABASE CONNECTION / DATA MODEL
Backend already inserts into 'campaigns' with org_id = req.organizationId, and reads from campaigns_with_totals filtered by org_id.
Confirm/ensure:
- campaigns table has org_id uuid NOT NULL referencing organizations.id (or organizations table id)
- slug is unique (db constraint)
- suggested_amounts is jsonb or numeric[]
- currency text default 'COP'
- is_active boolean default true
- created_at timestamp default now()

If any of these are missing, provide SQL migrations.

RLS / AUTH
- Ensure authMiddleware correctly resolves req.organizationId using organizations_users.
- Ensure Supabase RLS/policies or views allow:
  - org admin to select campaigns_with_totals rows for their org_id
  - org admin to insert/update/delete campaigns rows for their org_id
If RLS is not used because server uses service role, still ensure correctness of org scoping via req.organizationId.

UI BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
- After creating a campaign, it must appear immediately without manual refresh.
- Ensure React Query invalidation matches the list query key (['/api/campaigns']).
- If list fetch fails (401/400/500), show a visible error state/toast instead of just empty list.

DELIVERABLES
- List exactly what files changed.
- Explain briefly why campaigns weren’t appearing and how your fix resolves it.
- Confirm by running: create campaign -> list updates immediately.
