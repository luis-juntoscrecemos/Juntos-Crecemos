TASK: Fix the “Ver página” button under “Campañas” so it navigates to an existing route and shows the selected campaign (no 404).

CURRENT ISSUE
- In the “Campañas” page, clicking “Ver página” redirects to a URL that does not exist and results in a 404.
- Expected: Clicking “Ver página” should open the donor-facing public donation page for THAT specific campaign.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT
- The public donation route already exists and works as: `/donar/[campaign-name]`
- “campaign-name” should be the campaign slug (URL-safe).
- We must not introduce a new public route unless absolutely necessary. Use the existing `/donar/[campaign-slug]`.

WHAT TO CHANGE
1) Update the “Ver página” button link target:
   - It MUST navigate to `/donar/{campaign.slug}`
   - Do NOT link to any other route like `/campaigns/...` or `/campanas/...` unless those routes already exist.
   - Open in a new tab (preferred) OR same tab (acceptable).

2) Ensure `campaign.slug` is defined and URL-safe:
   - Slug must be stored in the campaigns table and always present.
   - If a campaign is missing a slug:
     - Generate one from the title (lowercase, hyphens, remove accents/special chars)
     - Save it to DB on campaign creation (and optionally backfill for existing campaigns).

3) Ensure the campaigns list fetch returns the fields required for the button:
   - id
   - title
   - slug
   - status

4) On `/donar/[campaign-name]` page:
   - Confirm it fetches the campaign by slug and renders the campaign view.
   - If the campaign is not found, show a friendly “Campaña no encontrada” state (not a generic 404).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Clicking “Ver página” from any campaign row opens `/donar/{campaign.slug}` without a 404.
- The page shows the correct campaign title/image/preset amounts for that campaign.
- If the slug is missing, it is generated and persisted so the link works going forward.

DELIVERABLES
- Fix the button link in the Campañas list component.
- Ensure slug exists for campaigns (creation + backfill script/migration if needed).
- Verify `/donar/[campaign-name]` route uses slug lookup and renders campaign.
